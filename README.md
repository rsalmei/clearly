## Clear and accurate real-time monitor for celery

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/clearly-celery/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/clearly-celery/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/clearly-celery/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Clearly is an alternative to [flower](https://github.com/mher/flower).
While I do like it, to me it's not been totally up to the task (pun intended).
Why is that? I'd like _actual_ real-time monitoring, filter multiple tasks at once and complete, whole, thorough, comprehensive results!
And flower needs page refreshes, filter only one task type at a time and truncates results... ðŸ˜ž

Ok, `clearly` does provide all that!  
And it works right in the terminal, has an advanced syntax coloring system, client server, multiple filters and complete results!
It's great to actually _see_ what's going on in your celery tasks, and in real-time, so it's great for debugging.

Actually, `clearly` does not have an outer process server yet (it is a thread), and it doesn't persist any data.
In the future it should have a proper server, with persistence, and a Docker image for simple deploying.
But regardless that, `clearly` is quite complete, and should complement flower nicely.

See what `clearly` looks like:

## Requirements

You can **always** use `clearly`! Regardless of your celery configuration!
- you just have to enable *Events* and you're good to go!

(previous version did not use celery events, so it had several limitations, that's gone)


## How `clearly` works

This tool creates a background thread with a celery events receiver, which receives events from all clients and all workers connected, dynamically updating states.

These events are processed and missing or out of order ones are dynamically generated, so you never see a STARTED task before it being RECEIVED, which would be weird. The parameters of the tasks are dynamically compiled, and beautifully syntax colored, while tasks completed get their results directly from the result backend, to overcome the problem of truncated results. All async workers life cycles are managed and listed on screen. All tasks triggered show up immediately on screen, and you start seeing what's going on with those tasks, in real-time!

At any moment, you can CTRL+C out of the client, and rest assured that the background thread will continue gathering all updates seamlessly.

DO NOT FEAR the memory consumption! It is very optimized, and by default only stores 1000 tasks and 100 workers at a time. You can increase them though.


## Features

`clearly` enables you to:
- Be informed of any and all tasks being requested and running, in real-time;
- Know the workers available and be notified if any goes down;
- Filter the async calls any way you want;
- Inspect the actual parameters the tasks were called with;
- See and analyze the outcome of these tasks, such as success results or fail tracebacks;
- _Clearly_ see all types and representations of the parameters/outcomes of the tasks with an advanced printing system, syntax highlighting and symbols, similar to what your favorite REPL would do;
- Analyze stats of your system.


## Get `clearly`

1. `pip install -U clearly`
2. there's no step 2.


## How to use

### initialize it

```python
from yourproject.celeryconf import app
from clearly import ClearlyClient
clearlycli = ClearlyClient(app)
```

### grab them

```python
clearlycli.capture()
```


### be amazed
![very amazed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsalmei/clearly/master/img/clearly_amazed.png)


### you can also grab like

```python
clearly.capture(show_params=True)
```


### and also be amazed

### note
Any way you capture them, `clearly` is always storing the same data about the tasks. The `show_params` is only informative, for you to see them right in the capture mode. You can see them later too, after capturing.
(The default is to `show_error`, as it is much more likely to get your interest)


### stop capturing and analyze

## Hints

- write a small [celery router](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/routing.html#routers) and in there generate dynamic routing keys, based on the actual arguments of the async call in place.
That way, you'll be able to filter tasks based on any of those constraints, like an id of an entity.
- if you're using [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [django-extensions](https://github.com/django-extensions/django-extensions), put in your settings a `SHELL_PLUS_POST_IMPORT` to auto import this!
Now you just have to create a pre-configured instance of it and you're good to go. Put together a simple python module in your project to provide an already initialized instance of `clearly`.
Now you have a tool always ready to be used, easily pluggable even in production, to actually see what's going on in your tasks, and figure out that pesky bug.
- the more you filter, the less you'll have to analyze, so find the best combination for you debugging needs. A busy system can have a thousand or more messages in only a minute.


## To do

- support python 3 (not actually tested yet, soon);
- implement a weak reference in tasks data, to be able to release the host's memory if the need arises;
- include a plugin system, to be able to print representations of custom objects;
- include a script mode, to call right from the shell (make work even a "| grep");
- any other ideas welcome!
